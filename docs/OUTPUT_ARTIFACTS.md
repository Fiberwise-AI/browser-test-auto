## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

```
fiberwise-browser-tests/
├── demo_sessions/         # Test output and logs (per test run)
├── temp-instances/        # Temporary app instances (per test run)
├── scripts/               # JSON test scripts
├── actions/               # Modular action handlers

## 📸 Screenshots

- **Location:** `demo_sessions/<script_name>_<timestamp>/screenshots/`
- **Purpose:** Captures the state of the browser at key steps (e.g., after navigation, login, errors).
- **Naming:** Screenshots are named by step and action (e.g., `03_navigate_dashboard.png`).
- **How to Enable:** Set `"take_screenshots": true` in your script settings or step config.

## 🎥 Videos

- **Location:** `demo_sessions/<script_name>_<timestamp>/videos/`
- **Purpose:** (If enabled) Records video of browser sessions for debugging and review.
- **How to Enable:** Set `"video_recording": true` in your script settings.

## 📂 Temp Instance Folder

- **Location:** `temp-instances/<instance_id>/`
- **Purpose:** Contains a full, isolated copy of the FiberWise app for the test run.
- **Contents:**
  - `logs/` — Server logs (`server.log`, `server_error.log`, etc.)
  - `local_data/` — SQLite database, uploads, app bundles, etc.
  - `.env.local`, `temp_settings.py` — Instance-specific config
  - All files needed to run the app instance
- **Lifecycle:** Created at the start of each test, cleaned up at the end (unless `auto_cleanup: false`).

## 📁 Demo Sessions Folder

- **Location:** `demo_sessions/<script_name>_<timestamp>/`
- **Purpose:** Stores all artifacts and logs for a specific test run.
- **Contents:**
  - `screenshots/` — All screenshots taken during the run
  - `videos/` — All videos recorded (if enabled)
  - `logs/` — Browser and console logs
  - `session_info.json` — Full log of steps, variables, and results
- **How to Use:** Review this folder after a test run for debugging, validation, and reporting.

## 🔍 Viewing Artifacts

- **Screenshots:** Open PNG files in the `screenshots/` folder with any image viewer.
- **Videos:** Play MP4/WebM files in the `videos/` folder with any media player.
- **Logs:** Open text files in the `logs/` folder for detailed step-by-step output and errors.
- **Session Info:** Open `session_info.json` for a structured summary of the test run, including all steps, variables, and captured data.

## 📝 Best Practices

- Always review screenshots and logs after a failed test.
- Use `auto_cleanup: false` to preserve all artifacts for manual inspection.
- Clean up old temp instances and demo sessions regularly to save disk space.
